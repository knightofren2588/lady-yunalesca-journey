# ✨ Lady Yunalesca's Journey - From Spira to Azeroth

**An ethereal crossover between Final Fantasy X and World of Warcraft**

Experience the legendary Lady Yunalesca as she transcends realms, bringing her eternal wisdom from Spira into the ever-changing world of Azeroth. Once the first summoner to defeat Sin, she now walks as a Shadow Priest, blending ancient summoning knowledge with the dark arts of the void.

## 🌌 The Story

Lady Yunalesca, eternal guardian of Zanarkand's Sacred Dome, has crossed the boundaries between worlds. Her thousand years of existence in Spira have prepared her for a new challenge - understanding and mastering Azeroth's complex magic while maintaining her ethereal wisdom. As both summoner and shadow priest, she bridges two worlds of power and sacrifice.

*"From Spira's spiral of death to Azeroth's endless conflicts - I have seen the truth that spans all worlds."*
